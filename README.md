# mcservermanager

A npm api to manage the Minecraft Server Process and handle all kinds of stuff with it

## Think of a way to select a version

The Problem their is that for spigot-1.8.8 is another Java Version then for 1.18 for example
So i have to think about a sdk manager like **sdkman** or **Jabba** later i could implement
support for both of them!

## Ideas

- [ ] Make an seperated versions folder so the the program dont have to download the versions over and over
